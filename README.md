# Server-Side-API---Weather-Dashboard
In this challenge we were tasked with creating a weather dashboard for travel where the user can enter a given city in the search bar to display curren and next 5 day weather for that city.  The application uses Open Weather API to pull weather data into the application as per the screenshots below.
