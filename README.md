# Server-Side-API---Weather-Dashboard
In this challenge we were tasked with creating a weather dashboard for travel where the user can enter a given city in the search bar to display current and next 5 day weather for that city.  The application uses Open Weather API to pull weather data into the application as per the screenshots below.  Additionally, cities searched by the user are also saved to local storage and are appended to the page as a button allowing the user to view weather for that state again.
